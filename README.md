NBU currency exchange rate for selected date

- This is a Mozilla Firefox extension, which adds the button to the toolbar.
- It could help you to retrieve NBU exchange rate for selected currency and date.
- By click on the toolbar button, you will get the popup menu with the main feature.
- By click on the rate button the rate it will be coppied to the clipboard.
- That's it!

I cannot guarantee the accuracy of the exchange rates displayed (it is provided from the NBUStats v1 "as is").
You should confirm current rates before making any transactions that could be affected by changes in the exchange rates
(the link to the API response for the selected currency and date is provided is under the NBUStats logo).
